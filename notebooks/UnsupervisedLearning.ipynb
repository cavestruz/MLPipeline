    "Above, we tried 3 clustering methods. The first is the k-means clustering, which works by choosing random center points for the given number of clusters. Then, we calculate distances to the centers from each data point. We then calculate a new cluster center by the formula v_i= 1/|c_i|\\sum_i^|c_i|x_i where |c_i| is the number of points in the ith cluster. If the cluster center doesn't move, we stop the algorithm otherwise we repeat the process. The drawback here is we have to manually enter the number of clusters, when in reality this may not be known. On the other hand, the mean shift algorithm puts a PDF on the data points and then uses a gradient method to find the nearest local maxima for each point and groups it by local maxima. The drawback here is finded the estimated bandwidth, which determines the complexity of the PDF. In reality, the estimated bandwidth function is hugely computationally intensive. Lastly, we also fitted a GMM using between 2-10 mixture models. As the GMM is the most complex algorithm and computationally much less intensive than mean_shift, and we did not calibrate the mean_shift bandiwdth properly we beleive that 9 GMM will fit the data best. Both the AIC and the BIC agree that 9 clusters is the best parameter for the GMM. The AIC will prefer a computationally complex model while the BIC ensures that we do not overfit the data.  The figure for the GMM is below.\n"
